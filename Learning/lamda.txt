1. Overview
In this quick tutorial, we'll learn how to use Java 8 lambda expressions with Cucumber.

2. Maven Configuration
First, we will need to add the following dependency to our pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>info.cukes</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-java8</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.5</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
The cucumber-java8 dependency can be found on Maven Central.

3. Step Definitions Using Lambda
Next, we will discuss how to write our Step Definitions using Java 8 lambda expressions:

public class ShoppingStepsDef implements En {

    private int budget = 0;

    public ShoppingStepsDef() {
        Given("I have (\\d+) in my wallet", (Integer money) -> budget = money);

        When("I buy .* with (\\d+)", (Integer price) -> budget -= price);

        Then("I should have (\\d+) in my wallet", (Integer finalBudget) ->
          assertEquals(budget, finalBudget.intValue()));
    }
}
We used a simple shopping feature as an example:

Given("I have (\\d+) in my wallet", (Integer money) -> budget = money);
Notice how:

In this step we set the initial budget, we have one parameter money with type Integer
As we are using one statement we didn't need curly braces
4. Test Scenario
Finally, let's take a look at our test scenarios:

Feature: Shopping

    Scenario: Track my budget
        Given I have 100 in my wallet
        When I buy milk with 10
        Then I should have 90 in my wallet

    Scenario: Track my budget
        Given I have 200 in my wallet
        When I buy rice with 20
        Then I should have 180 in my wallet
And the test configuration:

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = { "classpath:features/shopping.feature" })
public class ShoppingIntegrationTest {
    //
}
